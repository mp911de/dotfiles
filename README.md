## How to install

The installation step requires the [XCode Command Line
Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads) and may overwrite existing
dotfiles in your HOME and `.vim` directories.

```bash
$ bash -c "$(curl -fsSL raw.github.com/snusnu/dotfiles/master/bin/dotfiles)"
```

N.B. If you wish to fork this project and maintain your own dotfiles, you must
substitute my username for your own in the above command and the 2 variables
found at the top of the `bin/dotfiles` script.

## How to update

You should run the update when:

* You make a change to `~/.dotfiles/git/gitconfig` (the only file that is
  copied rather than symlinked).
* You want to pull changes from the remote repository.
* You want to update Homebrew formulae and Node packages.

Run the dotfiles command:

```bash
$ dotfiles
```

Options:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><code>-h</code>, <code>--help</code></td>
        <td>Help</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>--no-packages</code></td>
        <td>Suppress package updates</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>--no-sync</code></td>
        <td>Suppress pulling from the remote repository</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Custom OS X defaults

Custom OS X settings can be applied during the `dotfiles` process. They can
also be applied independently by running the following command:

```bash
$ osxprops
```

### Local/private Bash and Vim configuration

Any special-case Vim directives local to a machine should be stored in a
`~/.vimrc.local` file on that machine. The directives will then be automatically
imported into your master `.vimrc`.

Any private and custom Bash commands and configuration should be placed in a
`~/.bash_profile.local` file. This file will not be under version control or
committed to a public repository. If `~/.bash_profile.local` exists, it will be
sourced for inclusion in `bash_profile`.

Here is an example `~/.bash_profile.local`:

```bash
# PATH exports
PATH=$PATH:~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin
export PATH

# Git credentials
# Not under version control to prevent people from
# accidentally committing with your details
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="snusnu"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="your@email.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
# Set the credentials (modifies ~/.gitconfig)
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```

N.B. Because the `git/gitconfig` file is copied to `~/.gitconfig`, any private
git configuration specified in `~/.bash_profile.local` will not be committed to
your dotfiles repository.

### Custom location for Homebrew installation

If your Homebrew installation is not in `/usr/local` then you must prepend your
custom installation's `bin` to the PATH in a file called `~/.dotfilesrc`:

```bash
# Add `brew` command's custom location to PATH
PATH="/opt/acme/bin:$PATH"
```
